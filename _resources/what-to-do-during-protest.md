### Take part
More important than anything else, you’re there to show up for your cause. Take part and follow the direction of organizers. 

### Protect your identity
Guard your anonymity. Conceal as many identifiable characteristics as possible. Avoid surveillance. It might sound like overkill, but it’s not.

### Protect the identity of others
DO NOT upload photos or videos with metadata, protestors’ faces or identifiable markings.  Consider not taking photos or videos at all. Take a screenshot of your photo instead of posting the original photo directly. Doing this removes identifying metadata.

If you are a photo journalist or videographer, [follow responsible practices](https://twitter.com/sarahmcgphoto/status/1266936193373143041). 

At larger demonstrations, [Legal Observers](https://www.nlg.org/legalobservers/) will be on site to document events.

### Locate legal support
National Lawyers Guild (NLG) Legal Observers wear neon green. Alongside legal observation, NLG members often provide legal defense. 

### Locate street medics
Street medics are trained volunteers providing first aid care. They wear the universal red cross symbol on their clothing, bag, or body with duct tape.

### Stay as calm as possible
If you start to get stressed, take a minute to relax. Even if your rights have been violated, try to remain calm. Your adrenaline and survival instincts will kick in. Remember your cause goes beyond this one action. The movement needs you.
