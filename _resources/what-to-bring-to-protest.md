title: "What to bring to a protest"

## Supplies
* Drinking water
* Energizing snacks
* Cash, change, ID
* Prescription glasses (NOT contact lenses, to avoid further chemical weapon irritation)
* Permanent marker
* Easy-access backpack or tote bag for all supplies
* Sunscreen (oil-free, to avoid further chemical weapon irritation)

At any protest, you should plan for the possibility of arrest or medical emergency. You will want to bring:

* Several days of prescription medication, in its labeled original container if possible
* Menstrual pads (no guaranteed access to change tampons)
* Rescue medication you use (inhaler, epipen, etc.)
* Assistance devices you use (cane, etc.)

## Clothing

### Plain, solid-color long-sleeve shirt and plain, solid-color pants
Dress for anonymity. Cover as much of your skin as possible to a) prevent chemical weapons from sitting on your skin, b) obscure any identifiable tattoos or markings.

### Mask or bandana
Shield your face to protect your identity and limit the spread of COVID-19.  

### Comfortable shoes
Only wear closed-toe shoes that are easy to walk, stand, and run in for hours.  

### Sealed change of clothes
Keep a change of clothes in a plastic bag inside your supply bag. You can use these to change to avoid continued skin irritation from tear gas. Changing your clothes will also protect you against surveillance after the action.  

## Protection
The more geared up you are, the more likely police will want to start shit with you. Protect yourself to your own comfort level.  

### Shatter-resistant goggles
Any eye protection _that won’t shatter_ is better than no eye protection. “Less lethal” ammo causes permanent injury and death. Improperly-deployed tear gas canisters causes permanent injury and death. Pepper spray aimed at the eyes from a point blank range can cause blindness. Use swim goggles or safety goggles instead of safety glasses. Your sunglasses or prescription glasses are NOT enough protection.
  
Look for products with the following ratings:

* ANSI D5: filters fine dust (for tear gas)
* Z87+: particles + high impact (an in-between option at a lower cost)
* MIL PRF 32432 — military-grade ballistics (for rubber bullets)

### Head and face covering
Hong Kong protestors use standard yellow construction helmets for protection.

Consider using helmets made for high-impact or extreme sports.

* Hockey or football helmets effectively protect against head trauma.
* Airsoft metal mesh half-masks protect the lower half your face. They are designed to withstand BB shots when worn with a mouth guard.

At the very least, wear a hat and hoodie to help cover the top of your head and face from surveillance and direct pepper spray.

### Padding
The more space between you and a rubber bullet, the better. Consider knee or elbow pads to protect joints from injury during falls. Adult diapers can be used as padding. Keep your gear light for your own stamina and speed.
