> Your tools and equipment depend on what type of role you have at a protest.

### Umbrella
An open, sturdy umbrella can conceal activity and protect against chemical weapons.

### Heat-resistant gloves
Deployed tear gas canisters are hot. Heat resistant gloves include oven mitts and gloves for hair-styling tools.

### Lightweight shield
Shields protect against rubber bullets and other impact. Use foam (like a camping pad) to cover a garbage can or plastic storage bin lid to make your own.

### Laser pointer
Handheld, high-powered laser pointers can hinder aim, obscure vision, and block cameras.

### Spray bottle or flip-top bottle
Fill the bottle with either:
* clean water to flush eyes and clean skin from chemical weapons, or
* a baking-soda–water solution to help break down the tear gas particles.

### Traffic cone
Traffic cones can be set on top of a deployed tear gas canister. Pour a baking soda–water solution through top hole of the cone to help neutralize the tear gas particles.

### Oil paint, thickened acrylic paint, holi powder
When thrown, these pigments can obscure shield/visor vision. Thicken acrylic paint with flour or cornstarch.

### Leaf blower
Leaf blowers can diffuse tear gas out of the way of protestors.

### Plywood board
Sturdy marching signs can double as a shield.

### Bricks, stones, fencing
Strategically placed (and glued) debris can create barricades to block movement/vehicle traffic.
