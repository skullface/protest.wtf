Take on as much risk as you can so that risk does not fall on the shoulders of Black protestors. Do everything possible to protect trans and undocumented Black people. Protect their identity and security. White folks MUST leverage their privilege to protect Black folks from harm.

### Be a human shield 
If you see a Black person approaching law enforcement with no barricade, get between them. If they are on the ground, get on top of them. If they are kneeling or standing, get in front of them.

### Lock arms as a human barricade
Stand at the front line between Black protestors and police. Create a barricade by locking arms with others. Announce your intention: "white bodies, lock arms!"

### Be a wellness volunteer
Support your fellow protestors without specialized training. Distribute supplies like water, snacks, and sunscreen. Drive people. Move supplies. Receive training in basic first aid or eye flushing. Shout "MEDIC" when someone needs more advanced help.

### Show up
There is strength in numbers. Be part of the mass crowd — that’s what makes a protest a protest! Wield a sign. Chant. Be a champion of the cause. Show up.
