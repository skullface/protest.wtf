### Know your rights
Be as informed as possible before you head out for an action.
* [You have the right to remain silent](https://www.nlg.org/know-your-rights): National Lawyers Guild’s “Know Your Rights.” This is a pocket-sized PDF booklet for dealing with law enforcement.
* [Civil Liberties Defense Center: “Know Your Rights” for activists](https://cldc.org/know-your-rights-for-activists/): 1-hour activist training video and slide deck
* [ACTUP NY: Demonstrator rights](https://actupny.org/documents/demomanual/atthedemo.html): What the first Amendment and civil disobedience means when you are at a protest.
* [Up Against the Law: Interactions with law enforcement](http://upagainstthelaw.org/interactions-with-law-enforcement/): What to expect and how to best interact with law enforcement.

Remember our goals are not aligned with law enforcement. Remember that they **can** and **will** use **anything** you say against you and others.

### Consider your arrestability
Consider the following:
* Your own private legal concerns
* Jeopardy of employment or professional license
* Obligations to your family or work

Keep to those boundaries. 

### Find a buddy and commit with them
Don’t go alone! It’s always better to have a partner. Talk about your vulnerabilities, comfort level, and special skills. Determine and agree to your desired risk level and stick to it.

### Determine your place
Every action has many roles to fill — figure out where _you_ can help the most. You don’t need to be a hero, you just need to be a body.

### Learn about weapons they will use against you
Other countries have banned the “less lethal” ammunition that American police still use. This is because it can cause permanent harm and fatality. 
* Tear gas (RCA, CS gas)
* Pepper spray (OC pepper)
* Rubber bullets (rubber baton rounds)
* Wooden bullets (wooden baton rounds)

Get familiar with:
* their effects
* potential complications
* how to care for yourself after the fact ahead of time.

**Do not provide medical care beyond your training.** There are many urban legends about how to best treat tear gas and pepper spray — water is safest. Your goals are to keep it out of your eyes, out of your lungs, and off your skin.

### Protect your identity
Take steps to protect your digital data security and your physical safety. You cannot over prepare for this.

### Coordinate with an emergency contact
Determine an emergency contact who will not be on-site. Let them know you are demonstrating and let them know when you are safe at home. This person may be your phone call in case of arrest or who the hospital will notify in case of medical emergency.

### Make a jail support plan
Look up your city’s legal aid options for civil rights protestors. If you aren’t sure where to start, National Lawyers Guild (NLG) is a nationwide network. Write the legal aid phone number on your arm in permanent marker. They are equipped to help in the event of arrest.

* [Up Against the Law: Jail solidarity](http://upagainstthelaw.org/jail-solidarity/) 

### Determine escape routes and meeting sites
Have at least one escape route planned with your buddy. Have a meeting place if you and your buddy/group get separated. Consider agreeing on a meeting time as well. In a high-stress situations, you want to avoid improvisation.

### More ways to help that need preparation

* **Take part in street medic training**. If you have at least 20 hours of healthcare/medical training, volunteer as a street medic. This includes (nurse, EMT, herbalist, etc.). Established groups of street medics, like [NYC Action Medical](https://www.facebook.com/NYCactionmedical) provide bridge training.
* **Donate supplies to organizers and street medics**. Get in touch with your local activists to see where you can help with supplies. Often money is the best donation so organizers can get exactly what they need. 
* **Bring extra supplies to hand out**. Consider bringing universal supplies like the following:
  * snacks without common allergens
  * extra water
  * bug spray
  * sunscreen
  * hand sanitizer
  * bandages
